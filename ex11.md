#'require', 'include' , 'load'

##require

The require method takes the name of the file to require, as a string, as a single argument. This can either be a path to the file, such as ./lib/some_library.rb or a shortened name, such as some_library. If the argument is a path and complete filename, the require method will look there for the file. However, if the argument is a shortened name, the require method will search through a number of pre-defined directories on your system for that file. Using the shortened name is the most common way of using the require method.
The following example demonstrates how to use the require statement. The file test_library.rb is in the first code block. This file prints a message and defines a new class. The second code block is the file test_program.rb. This file loads the test_library.rb file using the require method and creates a new TestClass object.

puts "test_library included"

class TestClass
  def initialize
    puts "TestClass object created"
  end
end
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'test_library.rb'

t = TestClass.new

##Avoid Name Clashes with include

When writing reusable components, it's best not to declare many variables in the global scope outside any classes or methods or by using the $ prefix. This is to prevent something called "namespace pollution." If you declare too many names, another program or library might declare the same name and cause a name clash. When two completely unrelated libraries start changing each other's variables accidentally, things will break-- seemingly at random. This is a very difficult bug to track down and it's best just to avoid it.

To avoid name clashes, you can enclose everything in your library inside of a module statement. This will require people to refer to your classes and method by a fully qualified name such as MyLibrary::my_method, but it's worth it since name clashes generally won't occur. For people who want to have all of your class and method names in the global scope, they can do that using the include statement.

The following example repeats the previous example but encloses everything in a MyLibrary module. Two versions of my_program.rb are given; one that uses the include statement and one that does not.

puts "test_library included"

module MyLibrary
  class TestClass
    def initialize
      puts "TestClass object created"
    end
  end
end
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'test_library.rb'

t = MyLibrary::TestClass.new
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'test_library.rb'
include MyLibrary

t = TestClass.new

###Avoid Absolute Paths

Because reusable components often get moved around, it's also best not to use absolute paths in your require calls. An absolute path is a path like /home/user/code/library.rb. You'll notice that the file must be in that exact location in order to work. If the script is ever moved or your home directory ever changes, that require statement will stop working.

Instead of absolute paths, it's often common to create a ./lib directory in your Ruby program's directory. The ./lib directory is added to the $LOAD_PATH variable which stores the directories in which the require method searches for Ruby files. After that, if the file my_library.rb is stored in the lib directory, it can be loaded into your program with a simple require 'my_library' statement.

The following example is the same as the previous test_program.rb examples. However, it assumes the test_library.rb file is stored in the ./lib directory and loads it using the method described above.

#!/usr/bin/env ruby
$LOAD_PATH << './lib'
require 'test_library.rb'

t = TestClass.new


##Load Vs. Require
How do you load code into a Ruby program? There are two ways to do this. You're probably familiar with the ever-present require method, but what about its cousin, load? How does it differ? When should you use it?

###What 'require' Really Does

You probably use the require method every day, without much thought about what it's really doing, and how it works. And first off, yes, it is a method. It is a method in the Kernel module, but in MRI it is implemented in C (it would have to be, as Ruby has no API for loading and parsing Ruby files other than methods like require and load). But beyond "load code into your program," what does it do for you?

First off, there is the $LOAD_PATH (short version, $:). This is a global variable that holds an Array object of strings, each one describing a path where files can be loaded. This will include various paths in your system where Ruby's standard library lives, as well as some other things If you're using Rubygems, when the Rubygems library itself is loaded it will hijack the require method itself. Rubygems will search through its paths, but Rubygems paths generally don't appear in $LOAD_PATH.

Second, it loads more than Ruby files. Native extensions are loaded as .so, .dll or similar. These are files that hold compiled machine code, with symbol tables that Ruby then uses to hook up to Ruby methods. These are important, it's how Ruby touches the outside world. Any Ruby bindings to any library is bound to use one of these files. And you don't even know it, you just say require 'nokogiri', it doesn't matter to you that Nokogiri was compiled natively. The 'require' method figures out the extension you really want for you.

Lastly, the require method remembers what it has already loaded. If you require the same file twice, nothing at all will happen. The first time you require it, it will load the file as normal. The second time you require it, nothing will happen. The require method itself will even return false to signify this (if something goes really wrong and the file doesn't exist, a LoadError exception will be raised). The list of required modules can be found in the $LOADED_FEATURES global variable (short version is $").

###The 'load' Method

On to the load method. The load method can be thought of as requires less sophisticated cousin. It does the same job, but it doesn't do so in such a professional manner. Out of all the features outlined above, the load method only has one of these, and that's the load path. It doesn't guess which file extension you want, and it doesn't remember or even care what's been loaded or required already.

The load method also looks in the current directory for files. In Ruby 1.9.x (things were different in 1.8.x), the 'require' method will not look in the current directory for files to load. In fact, one (very small but still annoying hurdle) when upgrading to 1.9.x was this exact problem, which is solved by adding the current directory to the $LOAD_PATH global variable. If there is a file called module.rb in the current directory, require 'module' or even require 'module.rb' will not work, however require './test.rb' will. Or, slightly simpler, load 'test.rb'.

So why use load at all? Well, remember that load doesn't care if a file has already been loaded, it will gladly load the file a second time. Most of the time the declarations in that file will simple re-declare methods, classes and modules that have already been declared, which is perfectly fine in Ruby. However, there may be times when the side-effects of loading a file are desired, this is especially true when method calls are done in the file scope, loading the file again will execute those method calls again. And, of course, if for some reason the contents of the file changes between loads.
